3. **WebSocket Server**: Real-time updates for container status and metrics
4. **Docker Integration**: Direct communication with Docker API
5. **Proxy Management**: Dynamic Nginx configuration generation and management
   - Domain-based routing with automatic configuration generation
   - SSL/TLS certificate management and secure connections
   - Automated Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning and renewal
   - Advanced traffic management with load balancing, rate limiting, and WAF
6. **Metrics Collection**: System and container metrics collection and storage
   - Domain-specific traffic analytics and monitoring
   - Real-time traffic visualization and alerting

## Current Status & Vision

### Current Implementation Status
- The platform provides comprehensive container management with advanced proxy functionality
- Multi-domain reverse proxy capabilities allow routing traffic to different containers based on domain names

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests with coverage report
bun test:coverage

# Run frontend tests
bun test:frontend

# Run backend tests
bun test:backend

# Run integration tests
bun test:integration

# Run performance tests
bun test:performance
```

### Git Hooks

The project includes Git hooks to ensure code quality:

- **Pre-commit hook**: Runs tests on changed files
- **Pre-push hook**: Runs the full test suite and checks coverage

You can temporarily disable hooks using:

```bash
# For a single commit/push
SKIP_HOOKS=true git commit
SKIP_HOOKS=true git push

# For the current terminal session
bun hooks:skip
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

![Build Status](https://github.com/ataiva-software/kontainers/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)
![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ao/kontainers/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)

Kontainers uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Test Workflow

The test workflow runs on every push to the main branch and on pull requests:

- Sets up the Bun environment
- Installs dependencies
- Runs the test suite with coverage reporting
- Fails the build if test coverage falls below 80%
- Uploads coverage reports as artifacts
- Integrates with Codecov for coverage visualization

### Performance Testing

A separate workflow runs performance tests on a nightly schedule:

- Measures API response times and throughput
- Generates performance trend reports
- Tracks performance metrics over time

### Pull Request Integration

The CI pipeline integrates with pull requests to provide:

- Automated test results as PR comments
- Status checks that prevent merging if tests fail
- Coverage reports to ensure code quality

### Local Development Integration

The CI/CD pipeline is integrated with local development through Git hooks:

- Pre-commit hook runs tests on changed files
- Pre-push hook runs the full test suite
- Coverage checks ensure code quality

To view the CI/CD configuration, see the workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.
